# syns

One of the key things members of Slimming World must do to be successfull is to track how many syns they do every day and make sure they stay below the maximum number of syns allowed per day. 

This is an attempt to create a service/app to make it easy tracking your syns. 

This is also a simple project to run experiments and learn/improve software design techniques.
